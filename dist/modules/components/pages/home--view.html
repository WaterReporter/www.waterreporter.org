Use our app for iPhone or Android snap a picture while paddling (surfing, fishing, SUPing, canoeing, rafting, scouting wildlife, stream surveying, living the dream, observing pollution), describe your experience with a few words or hashtags, and share. We’ll keep track of your adventures, add them to the community map, and allow others to explore the world’s lakes, rivers, and oceans as they happen. </p> <p> Noticed a trash dump, fish kill, or something that just doesn’t look right in your waterway? Document it with our app and Water Reporter will connect you and your issue to our network of watershed professionals to help resolve the problem. With a free account, you can comment and view the actions taken by others to address your water quality threat. Water Reporter allows anyone to be the catalyst that sparks a grassroots stream cleanup or a new restoration project that improves the health of a local waterway. </p> </div> </main> <div data-ng-include="'/modules/shared/views/footer--view.html'"></div>
